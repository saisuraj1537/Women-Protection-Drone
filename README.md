A women protection drone is designed to rescue and assist women facing threats. If a man harasses a woman and she activates the SOS button on her mobile device, the drone locates her and rushes to the scene with police sirens. Simultaneously, it live streams the video of the situation. The loud siren not only alerts nearby authorities but also prompts local residents to come to the woman's aid.
